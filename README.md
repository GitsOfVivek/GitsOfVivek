# Hi 👋 ViveK here ☺

I'm a student who did *Bachelor of Arts(BA) in History*. I was new in Coding so I join **Newton School**. Here I will track my career and update that what I did previously and what I'm currently doing.
I'll explain here from scratch...
  - I joined Newton School for *Full Stack Web Development (August Batch 2022)*.
  - here in NS I'm learning Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) with Java language.

> I'm making my <a href="https://github.com/GitsOfVivek/DSA-with-Java-Notes" target="_blank">DSA Notes</a> in Java, which is you can refer if you want.✌️

You can see my Portfolio here (I know this is empty but very soon it will update) [Portfolio](https://www.github.com/GitsOfVivek/MyPortfolio)
